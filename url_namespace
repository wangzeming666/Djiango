application namespace
This describes the name of the application that is being deployed. 
Every instance of a single application will have the same application namespace. 
For example, Djangoâ€™s admin application has the somewhat predictable application namespace of 'admin'.
instance namespace
This identifies a specific instance of an application. Instance namespaces should be unique across your entire project.
However, an instance namespace can be the same as the application namespace. 
This is used to specify a default instance of an application. 
For example, the default Django admin instance has an instance namespace of 'admin'.
Namespaced URLs are specified using the ':' operator. 
For example, the main index page of the admin application is referenced using 'admin:index'.
This indicates a namespace of 'admin', and a named URL of 'index'.

Namespaces can also be nested.
The named URL 'sports:polls:index' would look for a pattern named 'index' in the namespace 'polls'
that is itself defined within the top-level namespace 'sports'.
