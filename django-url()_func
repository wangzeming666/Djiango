url()参数：

当Django找到一个正则表达式匹配时，Django会调用指定的视图函数，其中一个HttpRequest对象作为第一个参数，
任何来自正则表达式的“捕获”值作为其他参数。如果正则表达式使用简单的捕获，则值作为位置参数传递; 
如果它使用命名捕获，则值作为关键字参数传递。
任意关键词参数可以在字典中传递到目标视图。


url()

url(regex, view, kwargs=None, name=None)[source]
urlpatterns should be a list of url() instances. For example:

from django.conf.urls import include, url

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^index/$', index_view, name='main-view'),
    url(r'^weblog/', include('blog.urls')),
    ...
]
The regex parameter should be a string or ugettext_lazy() (see Translating URL patterns)
that contains a regular expression compatible with Python’s re module. 
Strings typically use raw string syntax (r'') so that they can contain sequences like \d without 
the need to escape the backslash with another backslash.

The view parameter is a view function or the result of as_view() for class-based views. It can also be an include().

The kwargs parameter allows you to pass additional arguments to the view function or method. 
See Passing extra options to view functions for an example.



Here’s the algorithm the URLconf parser(解析) follows, with respect to named groups vs. non-named groups in a regular expression:

If there are any named arguments, it will use those, ignoring(驳回诉讼) non-named arguments.
Otherwise, it will pass all non-named arguments as positional(位置的) arguments.
In both cases, any extra keyword arguments that have been given as per Passing extra options to view functions 
will also be passed to the view.



What the URLconf searches against

The URLconf searches against the requested URL, as a normal Python string. This does not include GET or POST parameters(参数),
or the domain name.

For example, in a request to https://www.example.com/myapp/, the URLconf will look for myapp/.

In a request to https://www.example.com/myapp/?page=3, the URLconf will look for myapp/.

The URLconf doesn’t look at the request method. In other words, all request methods – POST, GET, HEAD, etc. – will be routed(已选择路径) 
to the same function for the same URL.


Captured(俘获) arguments are always strings

Each captured argument is sent to the view as a plain Python string, regardless(不管) of what sort of match the regular 
expression makes. For example, in this URLconf line:

url(r'^articles/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/$', views.year_archive),
…the year argument passed to views.year_archive() will be a string,
not an integer(整数), even though the [0-9]{4} will only match integer strings.




Specifying(指定) defaults for view arguments

A convenient trick is to specify default parameters(参数) for your views’ arguments. Here’s an example URLconf and view:

# URLconf
from django.conf.urls import url
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^blog/$', views.page),
    url(r'^blog/page(?P<num>[0-9]+)/$', views.page),
]

# View (in blog/views.py)
def page(request, num="1"):
    # Output the appropriate page of blog entries, according to num.
    ...
    
    
In the above example, both URL patterns point to the same view – views.page – 
but the first pattern doesn’t capture(俘获) anything from the URL.
If the first pattern matches, the page() function will use its default argument for num, "1". 
If the second pattern matches, page() will use whatever num value was captured by the regex.

Each regular expression in a urlpatterns is compiled(编译) the first time it’s accessed[ˈækses].
This makes the system blazingly(公开宣布) fast.






Including other URLconfs

At any point, your urlpatterns can “include” other URLconf modules. This essentially “roots” a set of URLs below other ones.

For example, here’s an excerpt(摘录) of the URLconf for the Django website itself. It includes a number of other URLconfs:

from django.conf.urls import include, url

urlpatterns = [
    # ... snip ...
    url(r'^community/', include('django_website.aggregator.urls')),
    url(r'^contact/', include('django_website.contact.urls')),
    # ... snip ...
]
Note that the regular expressions in this example don’t have a $ (end-of-string match character)
but do include a trailing(后面的) slash(削减). Whenever Django encounters(遭遇) include() (django.conf.urls.include()), 
it chops(砍) off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf
for further processing.

Another possibility is to include additional(附加的) URL patterns by using a list of url() instances(实例). For example,
consider this URLconf:

from django.conf.urls import include, url

from apps.main import views as main_views
from credit import views as credit_views

extra_patterns = [
    url(r'^reports/$', credit_views.report),
    url(r'^reports/(?P<id>[0-9]+)/$', credit_views.report),
    url(r'^charge/$', credit_views.charge),
]

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', main_views.homepage),
    url(r'^help/', include('apps.help.urls')),
    url(r'^credit/', include(extra_patterns)),
]




In this example, the /credit/reports/ URL will be handled by the credit_views.report() Django view.

This can be used to remove redundancy(冗余) from URLconfs where a single pattern prefix(前缀) is used repeatedly. 
For example, consider this URLconf:

from django.conf.urls import url
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^(?P<page_slug>[\w-]+)-(?P<page_id>\w+)/history/$', views.history),
    url(r'^(?P<page_slug>[\w-]+)-(?P<page_id>\w+)/edit/$', views.edit),
    url(r'^(?P<page_slug>[\w-]+)-(?P<page_id>\w+)/discuss/$', views.discuss),
    url(r'^(?P<page_slug>[\w-]+)-(?P<page_id>\w+)/permissions/$', views.permissions),
]
We can improve this by stating the common path prefix only once and grouping the suffixes(后缀) that differ:

from django.conf.urls import include, url
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^(?P<page_slug>[\w-]+)-(?P<page_id>\w+)/', include([
        url(r'^history/$', views.history),
        url(r'^edit/$', views.edit),
        url(r'^discuss/$', views.discuss),
        url(r'^permissions/$', views.permissions),
    ])),
    ]
    
    
    
    
    
    Captured parameters

An included URLconf receives any captured(俘获) parameters(参数) from parent URLconfs, so the following example is valid:

# In settings/urls/main.py
from django.conf.urls import include, url

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^(?P<username>\w+)/blog/', include('foo.urls.blog')),
]

# In foo/urls/blog.py
from django.conf.urls import url
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.blog.index),
    url(r'^archive/$', views.blog.archive),
]
In the above example, the captured "username" variable(变量) is passed to the included URLconf, as expected.
